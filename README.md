# Customer-Segmentation-System
### What is customer segmentation?
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. This process makes it easier to target specific groups of customers with tailored products, services, and marketing strategies.
### Steps followed for customer segmentation:
* Create a business case
* Prepare the data
* Data analysis and exploration
* Clustering analysis
* Choosing optimal hyperparameters
* Visualization and interpretation
### Types of segmentation factors :
* Demographic : Age, gender, income, etc.
* Psychographic : Interests, lifestyles, priorities, etc.
* Behavioural : Purchasing & spending habits, user status, brand interactions, etc.
* Geographic : ZIP code, city, country, climate, etc.
### Advantages of customer segmentation :
* Price optimization
* Enhances optimization
* Brand awareness
* Acquisition & retention
* Increases revenue & ROI
## Unsupervised Learning 
It involves traning of machine using information that is neither classified nor labelled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.
Types : Association, Clustering.
### K-means Algorithm 
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. K-means clustering is a widely used method for cluster analysis where the aim is to partition a set of objects into K clusters in such a way that the sum of the squared distances between the objects and their assigned cluster mean is minimized.
Ways to choose the optimum K value: Elbow method , Purpose based
#### Steps of K-Means Algorithm
* Initialization
* Cluster Assignment
* Move centroid
* Optimization
* Convergence
